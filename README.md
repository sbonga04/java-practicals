# Hospital Management System (Java)

This project simulates a simple hospital patient management system using a custom implementation of a singly linked list in Java.
The system allows an administrator to admit, search, discharge, and sort patient records without using Javaâ€™s built in data structures.

## Features

- Admit a new patient
- Admit before a specific patient ID
- Search for a patient by ID
- Discharge a patient
- List all patients
- Sort records by patient ID
- Count total patients
- Console-based menu interface

## Technologies

- Java (OOP concepts)
- Custom Linked List implementation (no built-in Java collections)

## Files

- `Patient.java`: Contains the Patient class with attributes and methods
- `Node.java`: Contains the Node class for linked list implementation
- `HospitalManagementSystem.java`: Main class with linked list logic and menu system
- `problem.txt`: Full problem description (optional)

## Getting Started

Compile and run:
```bash
javac *.java
java HospitalManagementSystem
